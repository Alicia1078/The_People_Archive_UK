# 📂 The People’s Archive – Community Insights

This project was part of the **Escape Arts community initiative**, aiming to design an **accessible and inclusive digital archive** for the Stratford-upon-Avon community.  

As a **Data Analyst Intern**, I contributed to every stage of the process:  

<ul>
  <li>✅ <b>Designed and analysed</b> a user survey to explore browsing habits, accessibility needs, and content preferences.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Cleaned and transformed</b> raw survey data for reporting and visualisation.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Created interactive Power BI dashboards</b> to present insights clearly to stakeholders.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Summarised findings</b> in both short and full reports for different audiences.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Mapped user & admin workflows</b> to guide the archive’s design.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Proposed an AWS cloud architecture</b> for secure, scalable content management.</li>
</ul>

This project strengthened my <b>data analytics, visualisation, and system design skills</b>, while contributing to a <b>real-world accessibility challenge</b> that affects diverse community members.

### 🔑 Key Findings

<ul>
  <li>👥 <b>Older participants (60+)</b> were the most engaged contributors, while younger audiences preferred flexibility and mobile-friendly access.</li>
  <li>🖼️ <b>Photos, artwork, and short text stories</b> were the most popular content types.</li>
  <li>🎨 <b>High-contrast, simple layouts</b> were critical for accessibility, especially for older users.</li>

  <li>Implement <b>high-contrast, mobile-friendly designs</b> to support older audiences.</li>
  <li>Use <b>newsletters as the main update channel</b>, with social media as secondary.</li>
  <li>Keep chatbots optional—<b>older users prefer human help</b>, while younger users are more open.</li>
  <li>Offer <b>self-uploading as the primary contribution method</b>, but provide <b>workshops and assisted uploads</b> for less tech-confident participants.</li>
</ul>
